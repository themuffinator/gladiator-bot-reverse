 * TODO: Define the goal-state API mirroring Quake III's be_ai_goal.c module.
 * Responsibilities include allocating, resetting, and freeing goal states, loading
 * and indexing item weight configurations, and selecting long-term/nearby goals
 * so the exported botlib interface can call into routines such as
 * BotAllocGoalState, BotResetGoalState, BotLoadItemWeights, and BotChooseLTGItem.
