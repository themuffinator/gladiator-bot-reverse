/*
 * TODO: Declare weight configuration utilities similar to Quake III's be_ai_weight.c.
 * These should cover allocation/free routines, parsing of weight files, run-time
 * accessors like BotWeightIndex, and persistence helpers so exported interfaces can
 * manipulate weight configurations via BotAllocWeightConfig, BotLoadWeights, and
 * BotWriteWeights.
