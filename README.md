# gladiator-bot-reverse

DLL reverse-engineering effort for Q2 Gladiator Bot.

## Project Purpose

This project aims to reconstruct the Gladiator bot library (botlib) so that it
remains compatible with the original Gladiator mod for Quake II. The goal is to
recreate the original functionality and behavior while preserving support for
the original Area Awareness System (AAS) file format used by the mod. By
maintaining format compatibility, the reconstructed botlib can be used as a
drop-in replacement in environments that expect the original Gladiator assets.

- Mr Elusive for creating the Gladiator Bot and the Quake III Botlib.
- id Software for Quake II and Quake III Arena.
